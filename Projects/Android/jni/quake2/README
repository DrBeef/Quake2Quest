        Minor OS-oriented changes to id Software's Quake2 3.21: 
                        "Sorry, real life (tm) got in the way,0.16"

***************************************************************************
Important Note:  If you received an installer which installed the Quake II
demo levels, you may not distribute that installer or the demo levels in
anyway except electronically.  The Quake II demo levels are still Copyright
Id Software and are not covered by the Gnu Public License which governs the
source code.  Id has been kind enough to allow us to distribute these
levels with an installer to show users just how cool Quake II is in the
jopes that it will lead them to buy full versions.  Please do not harm
our relationship with Id by distributing the demo installer electronically.
***************************************************************************

(NOTE: throughout this document, references to i386 [debugi386, releasei386,
 gamei386.so] are used.  If your architecture is not i386, just substitute
 that for i386.  The Makefile gives some hints as to what is supported.)

For this to be of any use, you _must_ own a copy of Quake 2.  The demo would
also work, but you might as well buy the full thing now.

These modifications are intended for Linux users, as I do not have have
access to other platforms.

Be sure to install SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org) if you want to use the
softsdl or sdlgl drivers, or the sdlquake2 binary.

'make' will, by default, build both the debug and release files.
To build just the optimized binaries: make build_release
The resulting binaries are then put in releasei386.

Known Bugs
------------


Makefile options:
-----------------
(quake2 and gamei386.so are always built, but the following options can be
 changed by editing the Makefile)
BUILD_SDLQUAKE2		Build sdlquake2, a quake2 binary that uses SDL for
                        CD audio and sound access (default = YES).
BUILD_SVGA              Build ref_soft.so, a quake2 video driver that uses
                        SVGAlib (default = NO).
BUILD_X11               Build ref_softx.so, a quake2 video driver that uses
                        X11 (default = YES).

                        a quake2 video driver that uses fxMesa (default =
                        NO).  This option is currently untested because I do 
                        not have a Voodoo 1 or 2.
BUILD_SDL               Build ref_softsdl.so, a quake2 video driver that

7. copy <cdromdir>/Data/max/Rogue/video/ to <installdir>/rogue/ (optional)
8. when starting quake2, use "+set game rogue" on the command line

To Build Quake2 Max.
-------------------
Quake2 Max is a set of GL improvements to the Quake2 source base by
psychospaz, <http://modscape.telefragged.com/q2max/> the 0.25 version
has been merged into the Quake2 for Linux source tree.  To build the 
added visual candy:
1. make clean
2. set BUILD_QMAX to YES in the makefile
3. make

You will also need to download http://www.icculus.org/quake2/files/maxpak.pak
and place it in your quake2/baseq2 directory.

Please note that the resulting Quake2 binaries and video drivers are 
incompatible with binaries and drivers built with BUILD_QMAX set to NO.

For right now, the driver gets built as ref_glx.so and ref_sdlgl.so.  
In the future this will change so that both drivers can be build in parallel.


AALib Video Driver
------------------
The AALib video driver is written by jfedor@jfedor.org it provides text 
rendering for Quake2.  It requires the aalib package to build, which is
available at http://aa-project.sourceforge.net.

Retexturing Support
------------------
There has been an effort to retexture Quake2 with 24-bit textures to replace
8-bit ones.  The resulting textures look *good* but take up more space and
makes quake2 run slower.  

If you wish to run retextured quake2 you need to download pak1x (currently 0-6) from  http://3d.kicks-ass.net/texturepaks/

Thanks to Karen Pouelle for the code to support this.

To run:
-------
cd <installdir> && ./quake2
Or:
quake2 +set basedir <installdir>

Add +set game <moddir> to load a mod (like the mission packs).

/etc/quake2.conf is no longer used; instead, the ref_*.so files are loaded
from basedir (basedir is "." by default, and can only be set at the command
line).

Configuration files and such are saved in ~/.quake2/, so <installdir> can be
made read-only or whatever.

WARNING: Please do not make quake2 or any of the libraries suid root!  Doing
so is at your own risk.

NOTE: Save games will not work across different versions or builds, because
of the way they are stored.


Binary-Only Mods:
-----------------
Chances are that they will not work.  I suspect that it has something to do
with the mods being built with older versions of gcc/glibc2.  EraserBot, for
example, has source available except for one file, p_trail.o.  Trying to
use an EraserBot gamei386.so results in a crash somewhere inside p_trail.o.

Dedicated Server:
-----------------
Dedicated Server support has been added (thanks to Wesley Bear) just modify 
the Makefile so that BUILD_DEDICATED=YES (default NO) that should build a 
q2ded binary in the release directory.

CTF Server:
-----------
To run Capture The Flag, you need to do the following:
1) download q2-3.20-x86-full-ctf.exe from 
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2
2) unzip that file (using unzip -L) in a temp directory
3) copy ctf to <installdir>/ctf
4) build the ctf shared library (BUILD_CTF=YES in the Makefile)
5) cp releas<arch>/ctf/game<arch>.so to <installdir>/ctf/game<arch>.so
6) quake2 +set game ctf +set dedicated 1
7) on the console enter "map Q2CTF1" that will load up the first ctf
map, then connect using a client with multi-player.  For the other maps use
Q2CTF2, etc.

*Note if you are using the demo version and not the full version, some
textures are missing from the CTF levels*

IPv6 Support:
-------------
Currently experimental, so it may or may not work.  Here is some information
about it from Florent Parent:

quake2 +set dedicated 1
        Runs server listening on both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets

quake2 +set dedicated 1 +set multicast <interface>
        IPv6 server joins quake2 multicast group ff12::666

quake2 +set dedicated 1 +set ip <IPv6 address> +set multicast <interface>
        IPv6 server only. Listens on <IPv6 address>
        Examples of <IPv6 address>:
        3ffe:b00:c18::666              (global IPv6 address)
        fe80::202:b3ff:fe04:1234%fxp0  (link-local address. scope required)
        ::                             (unspecified, binds on all IPv6 
                                        addresses)
quake2 +set dedicated 1 +set ip <IPv4 address>
        IPv4 server only. Listens on <IPv4 address>
        0.0.0.0 can be used to bind on all IPv4 addresses

Joystick Support:
-----------------
***Important note**** 
5/12/04
The joystick code has been modified to be more in line
with the joystick functionality detailed in src/docs/joystick.txt
*********************

Joystick should function on all compatible SDL platforms using the sdlquake2
binary as well as on linux using the linux kernel joystick API.  If you want
to build with joystick support (the default) set BUILD_JOYSTICK to YES in
the Makefile.  

Have a look at src/docs/joystick.txt for the details

There is a single linux specific option: 
	* joy_dev : this sets the device name of the joystick to use (/dev/js*)


Windows Support:
----------------
In order to compile the source:

If you don't already have it, you'll need to download:
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/glext.h

Commonly used commands:
-----------------------
cd_nocd 0               // disable CD audio
s_initsound 0           // disable sound
_windowed_mouse 0       // disable mouse-grabbing
gl_ext_multitexture 0   // disable OpenGL Multitexturing (requires a
                           vid_restart)
vid_ref <driver>        // select a video driver (softx is the original
                           X11-only, softsdl is SDL software, sdlgl is 
                           SDL OpenGL)
vid_fullscreen 0        // disable fullscreen mode
vid_restart             // restart video driver
snd_restart             // restart sound driver
basedir <dir>           // point quake2 to where the data is
gl_driver <libGL.so>    // point quake2 to your libGL
dedicated 1             // run quake2 as a dedicated server
game <subdir>           // load the quake2 mod in that directory
sensitivity <int>       // Adjust the sensivity (accelleration) of the mouse.
crosshair <int>		// Choose your crosshair [1-3] Normal [1-9] Q2Max
crosshair_scale <int>   // Scale your crosshair (Q2Max only for now...)
skydistance <int>	// Modify the skybox distance (useful for large maps)

When using these commands on the quake2 command line, use +set to cause the
variables be set before the config files are loaded (important for
gl_driver). e.g.
./quake2 +set vid_ref glx +set gl_driver /usr/lib/libGL.so.1
Note that variables like basedir and game _require_ using +set to ensure
the desired functionality.

If quake2 crashes when trying to load an OpenGL based driver (glx, sdlgl),
make sure its not loading the wrong libGL.

Have a NVIDIA card and it _still_ crashes? Try 
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libGL.so, and run quake2 again.

Is lighting slow in OpenGL (while firing, explosions, etc.)? Disable
multitexturing (gl_ext_multitexture 0; vid_restart).

More information can be found in src/docs/.

Known Bugs and Workarounds:
